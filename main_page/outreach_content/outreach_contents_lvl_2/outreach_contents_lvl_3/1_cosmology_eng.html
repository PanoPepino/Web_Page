							<li>The universe is <strong>expanding</strong> in an accelerated manner. This expansion can be inferred from the redshift in the spectrum of light of galaxies (the observed frequencies are lower than than the emitted ones). This redshift is due to the dilation of the fabric of spacetime.</li>
							<li>Although the number of galaxies may seem endless, they only represent a <span style="font-size: 85%;">5%</span> of the total content of the observable universe.</li>
							<li>An extra <span style="font-size: 85%;">25%</span> of the contents of the universe corresponds to some type of non-interacting matter (i.e. not observable at any electromagnetic frequency). Its presence is inferred from gravitational effects on the rotation of galaxies. This matter is dubbed as <strong>dark matter</strong>.</li>
							<li>The remaining <span style="font-size: 85%;">70%</span> of the contents of the universe corresponds to a type of undetectable energy, called <strong>dark energy</strong> (represented by the ninja and known as <span style="font-family: monospace;">Λ</span> in physics), with <strong>positive</strong> energy value, but extremely small. This energy exerts a negative pressure on the universe, forcing it to expand acceleratedly and defeating the effects of gravity (the rocky creature) and its gravitational attraction.</li>
							<li>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">Λ</span>-CDM model is our best model to describe the cosmos and its evolution. It makes use of General Relativity and the Standard Model of Particle Physics, to describe how the four known forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetism and both weak and strong nuclear forces) dictate the evolution of the cosmos. The theoretical predictions of this model are in agreement with observations. However, it cannot provide explanation to some observations, like the origin, energy value and nature of dark energy.</li>
