							<li>String theory proposes that fundamental objects in Nature are not particles, but one-dimensional objects called strings. Particles would be understood as the vibrational modes of such strings, similar to how different vibrations of a guitar string produce different musical notes.</li>
							<li>Contrary to effective field theories, this theory has only one parameter, the length of the string, from which any other can be derived. Furthermore, this theory has no upper threshold of energy. It is well-defined at arbitrary high energies.</li>
							<li>The are two types of strings: open and closed. What makes string theory so interesting is that there is a vibrational mode of closed strings that represents the graviton, i.e., the quantum messenger particle of gravity. In this way, it is said that string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.</li>
							<li>However, string theory involves difficult challenges at both mathematical and conceptual levels. For that reason, physicists work at a lower energy regime, where the length of strings cannot be resolved and they look again like particles.</li>
							<li>String theory can be understood as supergravity in this regime. Supergravity, which provides a quantum description of gravity (the rocky creature) and the other fundamental forces (electromagnetism, the eel, the weak nuclear force, the radioactive imp, and the strong nuclear force, the glue creature) is also an effective field theory, acting as a bridge between the old effective field theories and string theory.</li>
