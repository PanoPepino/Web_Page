							<li>String theory also admits objects beyond one-dimensional strings. These objects are called branes and can have up to nine spatial dimensions.</li>
							<li>There exists an alternative type of constructions to explain how four-dimensional descriptions can arise from string theory. A braneworld model proposes that our three spatial dimensional universe is restricted to a three-dimensional brane, that can freely move through extra dimensions (similar to how the surface of a soap bubble, with two dimensions, can freely move in the three-dimensional environment).</li>
							<li>The Dark Bubble model is a braneworld construction that proposes that our universe lives on the surface of a four-dimensional "stringy" bubble that moves and expands in higher dimensions. This higher-dimensional space, contrary to regular compactifications, has five (time and four spatial) big dimensions and five compact ones. Similar to soap bubbles, the Dark Bubble separates an outside from an inside in the five-dimensional space.</li>
							<li>Although the dark energy value of the five-dimensional space is negative both inside and outside the bubble (<span style="font-family: monospace;">Λ<sub>5D</sub> &lt; 0</span>), the dark energy value perceived on the universe living on the brane results to be positive and really small (<span style="font-family: monospace;">Λ<sub>4D</sub>&gt;0</span>), like the one we observe in our universe. This is also similar to soap bubbles; the surface, which has a positive tension, separates between the outside, with lower air pressure than the inside. The tension appears as a difference between pressures.</li>
							<li>Furthermore, matter and any other features of the universe living on the brane can be understood as "reflections" of properties of the higher-dimensional space where the brane is moving, similar to reflections of the environment on the surface of a regular soap bubble.</li>
